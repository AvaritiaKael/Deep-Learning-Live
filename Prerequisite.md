# Theory
## Linear algebra
If you have taken any linear algebra course, and familiar with *vector*, *matrix*, *rank*, *transpose*, *determinate* and *eigen*, feel free to skip this part.

If you have no exposure to linear algebra, or it is too long ago that you forget details, reading through [Linear Algebra Cookbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/linear_algebra.html) would be a good choice.

## Calculus

## Programming
The talk will use [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) -- a deep learning framework that puts python first. Hence you need to know basics about [Python](https://www.python.org) and its numerical library [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org). If you are new to Python/Numpy, the [tutorial from CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) will help.
