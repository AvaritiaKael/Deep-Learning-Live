# *D*eep *L*earning *L*ive (DLL)
If you have any suggestion, please submit it in issues.

For example:

1. What kind of impression do you hold about DL?
2. How do you get to know about DL?
3. What do you want to know from this talk?
4. What do you expect from Deep Learning?
5. ...

PS: Issues in ZH/EN are both welcome, here I typed in EN cuz I haven't figured out how to install chinses input method on the suffering Ubuntu.
